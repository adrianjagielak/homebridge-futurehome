# homebridge-futurehome

Homebridge plugin to integrate [Futurehome](https://www.futurehome.io) devices into HomeKit

</span>

This uses the official public [FIMP API](https://github.com/futurehomeno/fimp-api) to communicate with the Futurehome Smarthub and expose all of the devices in Apple Home.

As of now, it supports a selection of services and device types, but it should be pretty easy to map new [Futurehome device services](https://github.com/futurehomeno/fimp-api/tree/master/device_services/generic) into [HomeKit services](https://developers.homebridge.io/#/service).

If you have any suggestions, questions, or non-working devices or services please [open an issue](https://github.com/adrianjagielak/homebridge-futurehome/issues).
